# Project: Hospital Management System

Description:

Developed a hospital management system using C++ to facilitate patient admission, doctor assignment, and appointment scheduling.
Implemented classes for Person, Patient, Doctor, and Hospital, leveraging object-oriented programming concepts such as inheritance, polymorphism, and encapsulation.
Designed functionalities to add medical history for patients and schedule appointments for doctors.

Key Contributions:

Created classes Patient and Doctor inheriting from the base class Person, ensuring code reusability and maintainability.
Implemented dynamic memory allocation for storing patients and doctors using vectors, allowing for efficient management of hospital resources.
Utilized standard library features such as chrono for handling appointment scheduling with accurate time tracking.

Technologies Used:

C++, Object-Oriented Programming (OOP), Standard Template Library (STL), Chrono Library

Achievements:

Streamlined patient admission process, enhancing hospital efficiency and organization.
Improved doctor-patient coordination through automated appointment scheduling, leading to enhanced patient care.

Time Complexity:

O(1) for admit_patient and assign_doctor functions.
O(n) for list_patients function.
O(m) for list_doctors function.

Space Complexity:

O(n + m) for storing patients and doctors.
